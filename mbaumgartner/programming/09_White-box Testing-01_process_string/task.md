You are given a function `process`. Implement a test class which ensures that any alternative implementations would exhibit the same behavior as `process`.

You should assume that `process` is in scope, just like in the template. You do not need to import `process`. Your solution will be graded based on how well it can recognize potential bugs in alternative implementations. Make sure you test edge cases for each of the parameters where appropriate.

**Important**: Use the provided template and do not change the name of the test class.

**Important**: You must hand in your test class, including the signature. Handing-in `process` is unnecessary.
