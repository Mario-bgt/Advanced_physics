Implement a class `Data` which takes a list of objects as the only constructor argument and refers to it using a public attribute `data`.

`Data` should provide a method `compute` which takes two functions as arguments. `compute` should call the given functions with the `Data` object's `data` as the argument and return the two resulting values in a tuple.

The `Data` class should work with arbitrary data types, as long as any functions passed are compatible with whatever `data` is stored.
