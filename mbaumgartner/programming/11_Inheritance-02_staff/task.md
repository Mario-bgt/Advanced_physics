## Problem description
You are working for a restaurant chain and are asked to implement the salary accounting software for their chain of restaurants and staff.

The chain runs several restaurants, each of which has a name.

The chain employs different kinds of staff, but regardless of type, any staff works for a specific restaurant and has a unique employee number (`101` for the first employee, `102` for the second, and so on). Furthermore, each staff holds a record of all shifts worked in the past. When a shift is worked, the number of hours is added to the shift record. Each staff also provides a way to determine the total salary earned by the staff, which is calculated depending on the type of staff.

A cook receives the same salary, no matter how many hours are worked. A server receives a base salary plus an hourly salary for each hour worked. For dish washers, the salary is computed the same way as for servers, but with a 10% deduction.

## Additional implementation instructions:
 * Fill in the missing class implementations in the provided template. Do **not** add any other top-level definitions.
 * Your classes *must* be compatible with the provided examples. Make sure their members are named appropriately.
 * You must minimize code duplication! Call super-methods where possible to re-use functionality implemented in super-classes.
 * Do **not** include any example calls in your submission. Submit only top-level class definitions and imports.
