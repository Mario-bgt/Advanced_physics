# Data Analysis in Python

Welcome to the Data Analysis in Python repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for performing various data analysis tasks using Python. Currently, the repository covers the analysis of Positronium lifetime, Compton scattering, and Stern-Gerlach experiments. Additionally, we plan to implement Laue crystal scattering analysis to further expand the capabilities of this toolkit.

## Background
Data analysis is a crucial component of scientific research, allowing us to extract meaningful insights from experimental data. This repository is designed to simplify and streamline the process of analyzing data from various experimental setups, including Positronium lifetime measurements, Compton scattering experiments, Stern-Gerlach apparatus, and upcoming Laue crystal scattering analysis.

## Features
- **Positronium Lifetime Analysis**: Analyze experimental data to determine the lifetime of positronium, an exotic atom composed of an electron and a positron.

- **Compton Scattering Analysis**: Perform Compton scattering analysis to investigate the phenomenon of X-ray scattering from electrons and gain insights into the energy-momentum relationship of photons.

- **Stern-Gerlach Analysis**: Study the quantum mechanical Stern-Gerlach experiment, which demonstrates the quantization of angular momentum and the quantization of spin angular momentum.

- **Laue Crystal Scattering (In Progress)**: Work in progress! This feature will enable the analysis of Laue crystal scattering experiments, which provide valuable information about crystal structures.
